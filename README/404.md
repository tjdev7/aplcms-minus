# Handling 404 Errors in the Austin Public Library's CMS

A 404 error is an HTTP status code indicating that the requested page or resource cannot be found on the server. When a user tries to access a non-existent page, the server will typically respond with a 404 error.

In the case of the Austin Public Library's website, which is built with Drupal, the site is configured to display a specific piece of content (node 7724406) when a 404 error occurs. This configuration can be found at `/admin/config/system/site-information`.

The content of the node's body field contains an unordered list (`<ul>`) with an ID of `error_messages`. Each list item (`<li>`) within this list represents a different cute message that can be displayed to the user when a 404 error occurs. Initially, all the messages are hidden using the `display:none` CSS property.

To randomly select and display one of the cute messages, a JavaScript code snippet is included in the node's body field. Here's how it works:

1. The script retrieves the `error_messages` element using `document.getElementById("error_messages")`.

2. It sets the margin of the `error_messages` element to 0 using `mess.style.margin = "0"`.

3. It retrieves all the `<li>` elements within the `error_messages` element using `mess.getElementsByTagName("li")` and stores them in the `count` variable.

4. It generates a random number between 0 and the number of `<li>` elements (exclusive) using `Math.floor(Math.random() * count.length)` and stores it in the `rando` variable.

5. It iterates over all the `<li>` elements using a `for` loop. For each iteration:
  - If the current index (`i`) matches the randomly generated number (`rando`), it sets the `display` property of the corresponding `<li>` element to `'block'`, making it visible.
  - Otherwise, it sets the `display` property of the `<li>` element to `'none'`, keeping it hidden.

By using this approach, the Austin Public Library's website randomly selects and displays one of the cute messages from the list whenever a 404 error occurs, providing a more engaging and user-friendly experience compared to a generic 404 error page.
