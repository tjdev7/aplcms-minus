# Handling URL Fragments to Enhance Site Usability

## Overview

In the process of updating and restructuring the content on our site, we encountered an issue with persistent URL fragments (`#:~:text=`) that interfered with our site's accordion components, particularly during the transition to a simplified URL structure for our library card information page. This documentation outlines the JavaScript solution implemented to address this issue, ensuring a seamless user experience and maintaining the integrity of our site's functionality.

The need arose from a published link to this URL: [https://library.austintexas.gov/eng/librarycard#:~:text=Adults%20living%20in%20Texas%2C%2018,place%20holds%20on%20physical%20materials.](https://library.austintexas.gov/eng/librarycard#:~:text=Adults%20living%20in%20Texas%2C%2018,place%20holds%20on%20physical%20materials.). The solution involved unpublishing and deleting the content associated with the "eng" language prefix, and re-creating the content only in "en" and "es" versions. The final step was redirecting users to the correct version of the page, with the "en" version being the default (implied) when no language prefix is specified. The JavaScript addresses the residual issue of the fragment identifier relic from the published link.

## Solution

To address this problem, we implemented a JavaScript solution designed to remove the fragment identifier from the URL after the page loads. This ensures that users are directed to the correct content without the unintended side effects caused by the fragment.

### JavaScript Implementation

The following JavaScript code was added to the site:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
    if (window.location.hash && window.location.hash.includes(':~:text=')) {
        // Use history.replaceState to manipulate the URL without reloading the page
        const newUrl = window.location.href.split('#')[0];
        window.history.replaceState({}, '', newUrl);
    }
});
```

#### How It Works

- The script listens for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure it runs after the initial HTML document has been fully loaded and parsed.
- It checks if the URL contains a hash (`window.location.hash`) and specifically looks for the text fragment identifier (`:~:text=`).
- If such a fragment is found, `history.replaceState()` is used to update the browser's history and the visible URL, removing the fragment. This is done without reloading the page, preserving the user's position and the page's state.

### Why This Approach

This JavaScript solution was implemented to ensure that users could access the intended content without disruption, particularly focusing on the functionality of accordion elements on the page. By removing the fragment identifier:

- We prevent potential conflicts with JavaScript or other interactive elements on the page, ensuring components like accordions operate correctly.
- We maintain a cleaner URL structure, improving usability and the overall user experience.
- We adhere to web best practices by ensuring our site's navigation and content accessibility are optimized for all users, in line with USWDS guidelines.

## Conclusion

The implementation of this JavaScript solution has significantly improved the site's functionality and user experience by addressing the specific challenges posed by URL fragments. This approach demonstrates our commitment to maintaining high standards of web accessibility and usability, consistent with the principles of the U.S. Web Design System.
